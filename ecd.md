# Code: 11200
Log Level: ERROR  
Message: HTTP retrieval failure  
Secondary Message: There was a failure attempting to retrieve the contents of this URL.    
Description: An 11200 error is an indicator of a connection failure between SignalWire and your  
service. When SignalWire requests a page from your server, we wait a maximum of
15 seconds for a response. A connection failure will occur if no response is
returned in that time.

There are many reasons a connection timeout can occur; common causes are long
running database queries or outside processes and calls to external systems
taking a long time to return. It may be possible your application experienced
one of these issues. If you are encountering this error only intermittently, it
is possible that your web server was temporarily unavailable or experiencing a
network outage.

### 502 Bad Gateway errors

If your [debugger](/user/account/debugger) is reporting a 502 Bad
Gateway error, this may mean that SignalWire’s internal server had trouble
retrieving content from your website. Your request must contain a
[Content-Type](/docs/errors/12300) that is valid. SignalWire may also have had
problems resolving your DNS name to an IP address, or issues with the network
connection. Check that your web server is started, and is available over the
public Internet.
Cause: * Web server returned a 4xx or 5xx HTTP response to SignalWire  
* Misconfigured Web Server
* Network disruptions between SignalWire and your web server
* No Content-Type header attached to response
* Content-Type doesn’t match actual content, e.g. an MP3 file that is being
served with `Content-Type: audio/x-wav`, instead of `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`
Solutions: * Double check that your LaML URL does not return a 4xx or 5xx error  
* Make certain that the URL does not perform a 302 redirect to an invalid URL
* Confirm the URL requested is not protected by HTTP Auth
* Make sure your web server allows HTTP POST requests to static resources (if
the URL refers to .xml or .html files)
* Verify your web server is up and responsive
* Check to see that the URL host is not a private or local IP address
* Verify the ping times and packet loss between your web server and https://signalwire.com

## Error - 11205 

### HTTP connection failure

There was a network failure attempting to connect to this URL. SignalWire will try for 10 seconds to establish a TCP connection to your URL (two 5 second attempts). SignalWire will wait for a total of 15 seconds to receive an HTTP response, this includes the TCP connection time, so if it took six seconds to establish a TCP connection, your server would have 9 seconds to deliver an HTTP response. If either of those timers expire we fail the request, fire a notification, and try your Fallback URL, if one is specified.

#### Possible Causes 
*  network outages between SignalWire and your web server
*  URLs that reference private IP addresses or localhost
*  SignalWire's TCP timeout is 10 seconds; so if you see an error in Request Inspector after > 10000 milliseconds SignalWire could locate your server, but could not establish a TCP connection with it. 
*  SignalWire's HTTP timeout is 15 seconds; if you see an error in Request Inspector returned after > 15000 milliseconds, SignalWire was able to establish a TCP connection with your server, but the HTTP response from the server failed.


#### Possible Solutions
*  verify the URL provided is accessible to the public internet	
*  verify network connectivity to your web server
*  check your TCP logs to verify inbound connection attempts are successful
*  check HTTP server logs to verify a response was generated and returned within the timeout
*  check your edge element logs to verify responses are making it out of your infrastructure

### Possible Causes 

*   The LaML that you are serving is larger than 64 kB
*   You are serving non-LaML content in your response

### Possible Solutions

*  Verify that you are serving LaML in your response to SignalWire's request. 
*  Verify that you are including this header in your LaML response: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`  
*  Limit your LaML response to 64 kB or less.
*  Does your LaML include the [Play verb](https://docs.signalwire.com/topics/laml-xml)? Double-check the size of the MP3 file you include and ensure it is 64kb or less.
*  Check that your LaML is formatted properly. To quickly verify your LaML, you can copy and paste it into a new [LaML bin in the SignalWire Console](https://docs.signalwire.com/topics/laml-xml).
*   Check to see if your application is throwing errors. This may cause your application to send a large debug output as HTML back to SignalWire instead of the expected LaML.
*  If you are trying to send a `200` response in a status callback, use an empty LaML response: `<Response/>`

### Document parse failure

SignalWire was unable to parse the provided XML Document.

Your LaML document must be a valid XML Document, or SignalWire will not
be able to read your document. You can debug XML parsing errors by
getting the response body in the [debugger](/user/account/debugger),
and then using an online validation tool like the
[W3C Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

#### Possible Causes
*   There is a leading space, or an empty line, before the XML type header (i.e. ` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`)
*   The root `<Response>` element is missing
*   There is an unclosed element
*   There is an unquoted attribute
*   There is an improperly nested element

#### Possible Solutions
*   Make sure there is no extra space or line at the beginning of the file before the type header
*   Make sure your root element is &lt;Response&gt;
*   XML is case sensitive, make sure your start and end elements match case. (SignalWire elements begin with a capital letter)
*   Make sure characters such as &lt; &gt; and &amp; are escaped properly, as `&lt; &gt; and &amp;`.

#### Authenticating requests to the SignalWire API

All requests to sensitive areas of the SignalWire API must use [HTTP Basic

and your Auth Token as the password. Both can be found in the [SignalWire
Console](/console/account/settings).

You can also generate revocable [API Keys](/docs/api/rest/keys) to authenticate.

You may want to consider using a [SignalWire helper library](/docs/libraries)

authentication for you.

[auth]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
Cause: * Using the wrong combination of Account SID and Auth Token   
* Using Test Credentials to access your Live Account
* Using subaccount credentials to access master account
* Previous Auth Token has been deleted
* Attempted API Key has been deleted
* Account is suspended or closed
* Extra characters or spaces in the supplied credentials
* Web proxy is stripping out credentials before forwarding to SignalWire
* Using JWT with Auth Token rather than API Key
Solutions: * Verify the Account SID and Auth Token are correct  
* Verify the correct Account is being accessed

Description: null  
Cause: null  
Solutions: null  
Docs:
## Not Found

The resource was not found. Here are some examples of cases that may trigger
a 404 error.

- Requesting a resource for a sid that does not exist, for example

        GET /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC123/Calls/CA123

    where CA123 is not a call sid that exists for your account

- Trying to retrieve a resource that doesn't exist, for example

        GET /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC123/SignalWireCalls/CA123

    where the resource name is Calls, not SignalWireCalls. Note that the API is
    case sensitive, so requesting "calls" instead of "Calls" will also return a
    404.

- Missing a sid in the request path. For example, let's say I accidentally
don't set a value for a call sid, using the PHP helper library:

        $callSid = null;
        $client->account->calls->get($callSid);

    This may turn into

        GET /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC123/Calls/.json

    because of the nonexistent sid, which may 404 your request or give you back
    a result you were not expecting. Or, you may initialize the client with an
    empty string for an account sid, which means the URL will get truncated in
    the middle (note the consecutive slashes):

        GET /2010-04-01/Accounts//Calls/CA123.json

### TLS and cipher suite upgrade requirements
In moving towards a more secure posture with regards to [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), we require that all new accounts must use TLS v1.2 or later. All customers must use TLS > 1.2 starting June 26, 2019.

Customers running older operating systems or legacy network software may need to upgrade their systems to be compatible with these changes. If you've received Error 20426, you likely need to upgrade your system.

To learn more about these changes, see our support site's FAQ on [SignalWire REST API’s TLS and Cipher Suite Security Changes](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s)

### Tips for upgrading your environment
To learn more about SignalWire's TLS and cipher requirements, please reference [this support article](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s) where you can learn more about understanding failure signatures, which components to upgrade, and verifying your upgrade.

### Internal Server Error

The SignalWire API encountered an error when processing your request. This generally indicates an error in the server handling logic or a timeout in the API. We apologize for the inconvenience.

#### I'm seeing a lot of these


#### Is the request safe to retry?

GET and DELETE requests are always safe for you to retry as they are idempotent. Some POST requests are idempotent by nature - purchasing a specific phone number, or hanging up a call - and while these may return different HTTP status codes on each attempt, the end state of the system will be the same whether you make the request one time or ten.

Other POST requests - sending an SMS or triggering an outbound call - are not idempotent. If you get a 500 Server Error on these requests, and you retry the request, it is possible for a customer to receive multiple messages or calls from your application.

### The 'From' phone number provided is not a valid, message-capable SignalWire phone number.

You can only send SMS messages from a phone number or [short
code](https://signalwire.com) provided by or ported to SignalWire, and
that phone number must be SMS-capable.

Visit the [phone numbers page](https://signalwire.com) of your account portal to view a list
of phone numbers that you own and to determine whether they are
SMS-capable.

Due to anti-spam regulations, the number a user sees when you send an SMS using
your application must be the same SignalWire number associated with that account.
This differs from voice calls, where it is possible to display a verified
caller ID other than your SignalWire number.

### Possible solutions
*  Check that you are using a SignalWire phone number with SMS capabilities. You can see your purchased phone numbers and their capabilities in the [SignalWire console](https://signalwire.com).
*  If sending the message globally, verify that your `From` phone number is capable of sending messages and you have enabled [geographic permissions](https://signalwire.com) for your account.
*  If you are sending messages with test credentials, verify that you are using one of the [available test credential "magic phone numbers"](https://signalwire.com)

#### Sending global SMS

Only certain countries and phone numbers are currently able to send
global SMS messages. You may have received this error while trying
to send from a number which is not capable of sending Global SMS
messages. For more information, including an up to date list of countries
that can send messages globally, please see our [FAQ page on Global
SMS](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s).

#### Test Credentials

If you received this error while trying to authenticate with your Test
Credentials, you probably tried to send a message with a `From` number from
your live account. 

The only number that can be used to send `successful`
messages with your Test Credentials is `+1XXXYYYZZZZ`. 

For more information,
read our documentation on [the `From` number for sending SMS with your test
credentials][from-test-credentials] and check out this blog post on [using SignalWire's test credentials with magic numbers](https://signalwire.com).

Previously the IncomingPhoneNumbers API would look at your account for an appropriate address, however, you are now required to pass in an AddressSid that satisfies the requirement for the phone number.  This is because SignalWire needs to know which address will be operating the phone number to meet regulatory requirements for that country and type of phone number.  
Cause: - No address was provided   
- No address was that satisfies the locality requirement for this phone number type.

### Possible Causes 
*  The destination handset you are trying to reach is switched off or otherwise unavailable.
*  The device you are trying to reach does not have sufficient signal
*  The device cannot receive SMS (for example, the phone number belongs to a landline)
*  There is an issue with the mobile carrier

### Possible Solutions
The first step to troubleshooting this issue is to attempt to replicate the problems. Attempt to send another test message to this user via a REST API request, or through the API Explorer in the [SignalWire Console](https://signalwire.com). 

If you see similar results, continue troubleshooting with the following checklist:
*  Is the destination device powered on?
*  Does the device have sufficient signal? If not power the device off, wait 30 seconds, and then power it back up.
*  Is the device connected to the home carrier's network? We cannot guarantee message delivery on devices roaming off-network.
*  Can the device receive non-SignalWire SMS?
*  Can the device receive messages from another SignalWire number (non-Alphanumeric Sender ID), or with a shorter one-segment (non-concatenated) body?
*  Can other devices using the same mobile carrier receive your messages?

If you can rule out all of the above issues, continue troubleshooting below.

#### Messages sent from short codes
Repeated Error 30003 results on undelivered messages sent from [short codes](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s) could occur if the destination user has a wireless plan that does not support short code or "Premium" messages.

To workaround these plan limitations, we suggest using the **Fallback to Long Code** feature of [Messaging CoPilot](https://signalwire.com).

**Sprint** customers may be able to whitelist messages sent from your short code by texting the phrase `Allow XXXXX` to **9999**, replacing `XXXXX` with your short code. However, customers from other wireless carriers will likely need to reach out to their carrier's support group to enable "Premium" or short code messaging.

#### Messages sent from long codes
Repeated Error 30003 results on undelivered messages sent from long codes (regular phone numbers) could be due to carrier filtering. 

The rules for carrier filtering vary throughout the industry, making it difficult at times to pin down exactly why a message is being filtered out. For more details including potential workarounds, please see this Help Center article ["How Does Carrier Filtering Work?"](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s)

If you can rule out all of the above issues, continue troubleshooting below.

#### "Undelivered" messages sent to India
Error 30004 results on undelivered messages sent to India could be due to the destination number being listed on the national Do Not Call (DNC) registry. 

For more information on sending messages to India, including links for updating DNC settings, please see our help center article on [limitations for sending SMS to India](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s).

#### "Failed" messages
Repeated messages with a `Failed` status and error 30004 results indicate SignalWire may be filtering some of your messages internally. 

This filtering is in place to help protect our customers, and the rules attempt to match what we have observed from the industry. For more details, including potential workarounds, please see our help center article ["How Does Carrier Filtering Work?"](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s)

## Error - 30008

### Message Delivery - Unknown error

If a message you sent is not delivered to the end device and returns a 30008 error code, this means that delivery of your message failed for unknown reasons.

When SignalWire receives a very generic error from our carrier partner that we have no further details about, we associate the message with the error code 30008, letting you know that SignalWire truly doesn’t know what caused this error from the provider.

#### Possible Solutions
* Check that the phone you were sending to is turned on and can receive non-SignalWire SMS
* Ensure that the phone is not roaming off network. We cannot guarantee message delivery on roaming phones.
* Try sending to other phones who have the same mobile carrier (you can use our Lookups API to determine the carrier if you’re unsure). If messages to other phones go through, the issue is likely device related. Try rebooting the device or contact the mobile carrier for help.
* If you are sending SMS from an alphanumeric sender ID, see if using a SignalWire phone number works better. We’ve observed that certain networks may block alpha sender IDs.
* If the recipient number is another SignalWire number, ensure that number has an action configured for its Messaging capabilities. Choose any available option like "Webhook" or "LaML Bin."
* Try sending a shorter message to the phone, with simple content that does not include any special characters. This would give our support team an idea as to whether the failure is related to concatenation or character encoding.
* SignalWire support can help investigate what went wrong with our carriers. Please open a support request and include a minimum of 3 or more message SIDs where a 30008 error was thrown. Per our carriers' requirements, these SIDs can be no older than 48 hours at most.

## Warning - 32011

### Error communicating with your SIP communications infrastructure
There was a problem communicating with a specific endpoint of your SIP communications infrastructure. This means there was either a lack of timely response, an error response or an invalid response from your SIP endpoint. This may result in increased call setup times or even failed call depending on the failover configuration for your Elastic SIP Trunk or SIP application. SignalWire will make multiple attempts to deliver calls to your endpoint and each failed attempt will have it's own notification.
The notification will have details about the specific error response and the SIP URI that causes the failure.

#### Possible Causes 
* Your SIP endpoint is not reachable due to network connectivity issue between SignalWire and your system
* Your SIP endpoint is not responding (service down or maintenance) 
* There is a firewall in your network that is blocking SIP traffic from SignalWire
* Your SIP endpoint is sending an error response, such as SIP 500 response.
* The SIP URI specified in your Trunking Origination URI, <Dial> <SIP> LaML or REST API call is invalid

#### Possible Solutions
* Ensure the SIP URI used in the request is correctly configured.
 * For details on how to configure your Origination URIs for SIP trunking, please see [Origination settings](/docs/api/sip-trunking/getting-started#origination).
* Ensure that your SIP servers are running properly and is properly processing calls from SignalWire.

Cause: * The user-portion of the URI contains invalid characters. The user-info portion allows alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and a small number of additional punctuation characters.  
* A URI header or parameter value contains punctuation or whitespace that is not escaped.
Solutions: * If you specify SIP headers in your URI, ensure any non-alphanumeric characters in the header values are escaped. For example, to add a User-to-User header with value `0A1B2C3D;encoding=hex`, you must encode this into the URI as `User-to-User=0A1B2C3D%3Bencoding%3Dhex`.

## Error - 52002

### Invalid Credential Sid
In order to send push notifications to iOS and Android devices you need to configure a Credential that allows SignalWire to send notifications to your app. 

You can configure these at different places depending on which SignalWire product you use:

* Chat: Configure in access token
* Notify: Configure default Credential in Notify Service or Binding specific one in Binding
* Voice SDK: Configure in access token

#### Possible Causes 
*   Credential SID is not configured correctly

#### Possible Solutions
* If using Chat include Credential SID in access token. Check out this [guide](https://signalwire.com)
*  If using Notify, either configure default Credential SID in your [Service](https://signalwire.com) request
* If using Voice SDK, include Credential SID in access token. Check out our [documentation](https://signalwire.com) for details

#### Possible Causes 
*  Type of credential provided in access token does not match that of the registration. For example you included the SID of a APS type Credential in the access token for an Android application using GCM.

#### Possible Solutions
*  Make sure you provide the right Credential SID in the access token.

## Error - 52004

### Credential SID not specified

Credential SIDs are used to determine which Credential resource to use to send a given push notification (APNS, FCM or GCM). For each delivery attempt the system tries to select a Credential SID depending on the API request and configuration. This error indicates that the system did not find any available Credential SID to use and hence failed to send the delivery attempt.

#### Possible Causes 
Configuration is slightly different depending on which SignalWire API and product you are using.
*  Notify: Credential SID can be specified in the Notify Service or in the Binding. This error indicates neither of those were specified.
*  Chat, Voice, Account Security: Credential SID can be specified in the SignalWire Access Token used to register for push notifications. This error indicates that the token missed that information.

#### Possible Solutions
*  Notify: Set the Credential SID either in the Notify Service or in the Create Binding request
*  Chat, Voice, Account Security: Set the Credential SiD in the Access Token

The media will not be accessible directly from SignalWire until we remediate the situation but the composition media file has probably been stored safely to S3.

#### Causes

 * An internal error prevented us from updating a resource. Sorry!

#### Solutions

*   Please <a href="https://signalwire.com/support">contact us</a> to figure out what has happened and how to fix it!
*   Note the time of the error and what you were trying to do when it occurred!

## Error - 54003

### Sync: Invalid If-Match header
The specified If-Match header cannot be used for concurrency control.

#### Possible Causes
* The value specified in the If-Match header is not a valid Sync object revision.

#### Possible Solutions
The value you provide should be a revision assigned by the Sync service when interacting with an object.

* In SDKs, this is the `revision` field, part of the object descriptor.
* When using REST (e.g. via the SignalWire Helper libraries) this is the `ETag` header provided in responses.

## Error - 54007

### Sync: Access forbidden for identity
The identity specified in the Access Token does not have permissions to perform this operation.

#### Possible Causes
* Sync's ACL control has been unintentionally enabled on your Sync service instance.
* An SDK endpoint trying to read or write a Sync object does not have the correct permission configured.
* The identity you specified in your SDK's token does not match the permissions that you intended for them.

#### Possible Solutions
* Disable the ACL feature on this Sync service. This will allow access from any SDK with a valid token.
Do this by either unchecking the AclEnabled feature in the [SignalWire Console](https://signalwire.com).
* Confirm a valid permission is configured via the [Sync Permissions REST API](https://signalwire.com), and that the configured identity matches the identity you provide in your FPA Access Tokens.

### Sync: Invalid JSON
The specified 'Data' parameter is not valid JSON.

#### Possible Causes
* The data you submitted is not JSON, or
* A missing or poorly-encoded character makes your JSON fail to parse.
* You crafted the HTTP request yourself, and did not percent-encode the submitted JSON data in the form parameters.

#### Possible Solutions
* Use a tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to check the data you're sending for syntax errors.
* If you're crafting HTTP requests yourself, make sure all form data is percent-encoded.

## Error - 54009

### Sync: Rate limit exceeded
The rate of access to this resource exceeds the prescribed limits.

#### Possible Causes
* Your application is opening, reading or querying a single Sync object or its sub-items too often.
* Your application is updating a single Sync object or its sub-items too often.
* Your application is creating new Sync objects or their sub-items too often.

#### Possible Solutions
* Analyze your application to ensure that the _sustained_ rate of reads and writes against a single Sync object, and the sustained rate of of new object creations, is below 20 per second during normal application activity. Note that this limit only applies to explicit reads or writes; delivered state updates are not limited.
* Analyze your application to ensure that bursts of activity are uncommon; Sync provides a ten-second burst window during which you can exceed the sustained request-rate limits.
* Make sure your application (client or backend) uses a good exponential back-off algorithm like [the one advocated by Amazon](https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html) to retry on HTTP 429 (rate limiting) responses.
